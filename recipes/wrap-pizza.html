<h3> Make it your way! </h3>
<p> The wrap pizza is versatile and light. It's interchangeable, and can be as complex or
    as simple as you want. My go to, is just a plain cheese pizza with a pepperoni and fresh
    red onion topping. For the sake of this recipe however, we're going to go with pepperoni and
    pepper for our toppings. And we're going to make 2 wrap pizzas.</p>

<p><strong> Ingredients you're going to need: </strong></p>

<ul> 
    <li>2x Tortilla Wraps of your choice</li>
        <li>A whole pepper (Green or Red)</li>
            <li>Pepperoni Slices</li>
                <li>200g Mature Cheddar</li>
                    <li>100g Tomato Puree</li>
                        <li>25g Italian Herb Blend Spices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Begin by preparing your choice of pepper, cut into into halves, and then again until
        they are in slices. </li>
    <li> Take your tortilla wraps, and cover liberally with Tomato Puree. After they are covered,
        finish with some light sprinkling of the Italian Herb Blend Spices</li>
        <li> Grate your cheese and cover the puree base until you are satisified. Add pepperoni to your liking, and add peppers. </li>
        <li> At this point, I like to add a little more Italian Herb Blend to make it taste more authentic. </li>
        <li> Turn on your grill, and place the pizzas under on a heat-proof cooking pan. Grill for 2.5 minutes on each side, turning as necessary </li>
        <li> After 5 minutes, cut and serve the pizza to your liking. </li>
    </ol>
