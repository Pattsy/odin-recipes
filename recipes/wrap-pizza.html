<h4> Make it your way! </h4>
<p> The wrap pizza is versatile and light. It's interchangeable, and can be as complex or
    as simple as you want. My go to, is just a plain cheese pizza with a pepperoni and fresh
    red onion topping. For the sake of this recipe however, we're going to go with pepperoni and
    pepper for our toppings. And we're going to make 2 wrap pizzas.</p>

<p><strong> Ingredients you're going to need: </strong></p>

<ul> 
    <li>2x Tortilla Wraps of your choice</li>
        <li>A whole pepper (Green or Red)</li>
            <li>Pepperoni Slices</li>
                <li>200g Mature Cheddar</li>
                    <li>100g Tomato Puree</li>
                        <li>25g Italian Herb Blend</li>
</ul>
