<p> 
    This is dedicated to Brioni-Leigh Mackinnon. A woman that, while I love, does not know how to make a cup of tea.
    This project then is dedicated to helping her achieve her greatness in tea-making. The art of
    tea blending is not all that complex, but I imagine her huge brain has been used primarily
    for the intake of tooth nonce subjects, and has not been utilized solely to make the best 
    cup of tea possible; and so for this reason, I will let her off.
</p>

<p> However, now she must learn how to properly make a cup of tea and it does not, in any way, include
    dipping toast into it. If I even suspect you are using this recipe to dip toast into,
    I will take it down with good conscience.
</p>

<h3> Ingredients you will need </h3>
<ul>
<li> A trusty mug (a cup, not your most idiotic friend)</li>
<li> A dollop of milk (about this much)</li>
<li> A sturdy metal spoon.</li>
<li> A Yorkshire tea bag </li>
<li> An electric kettle </li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
<li> Put your Yorkshire tea bag in your trusty mug. </li>
<li> Stick the kettle on, and pet your dog while you wait </li>
<li> Once boiled, pour the boiling water into the cup, a little over half way </li>
<li> Stir for a brief period before battering the absolute living shit out of the tea bag and pressing it tightly against the sides of mug to drain the flavour </li>
<li> Leave the tea bag in whilst you add your dollop of milk, and stir again briefly. </li>
<li> Remove tea bag and enjoy </li>
</ol>
