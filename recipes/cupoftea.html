<h1> A Proper Cup of Tea </h1>

<p> 
    This is dedicated to Brioni-Leigh Mackinnon. A woman that, while I love, does not know how to make a cup of tea.
    This project then is dedicated to helping her achieve her greatness in tea-making. The art of
    tea blending is not all that complex, but I imagine her huge brain has been used primarily
    for the intake of tooth nonce subjects, and has not been utilized solely to make best 
    cup of tea possible; and so for this reason, I will let her off.
</p>

<p> However, now she must learn how to properly make a cup of tea and it does not, in any way include
    dipping toast into it. If I even suspect you are using this recipe to dip toast into,
    I will take it down with good conscience.
